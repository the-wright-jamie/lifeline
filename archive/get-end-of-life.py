"""
This is the original proof-of-concept for Lifeline. I originally
wrote it to get familiar with the end-of-life API and to
prove that it is indeed possible to get and parse info from it.

The original idea was to use Jenkins to run (what would have
been) a further developed version of this script which would
have created JIRA tickets which then could be placed into an
EPIC, which then would have created a Gantt chart in JIRA.

Despite then learning how to use the JIRA API I discovered that
I didn't have the JIRA permissions to do this ðŸ˜…

After being stumped for a bit, I decided to just make a web
based dashboard instead which I figured would allow for more
interactivity and user control anyway, and would have been
more helpful for general public use anyway. So, one thing lead
to another, and now we have Lifeline.

This script was created in August 2024.
